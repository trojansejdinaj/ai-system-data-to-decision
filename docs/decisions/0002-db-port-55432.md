# 0002 - Use localhost:55432 for Postgres

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Port 5432 is commonly occupied by other local Postgres instances or containers.

## Decision
- Map container `5432` to host `55432`.
- Default `.env.example` and docs reference `55432`.

## Consequences
- Fewer local collisions.
- Anyone changing ports must update `.env` / `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.
